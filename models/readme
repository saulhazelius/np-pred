The predict_fams.py script predicts the probability that a NMR spectra correspond to a natural product family. The script loads the the .dat files that correspond to the trained XGBoost models.  
 
Each model yields a value indicating the probability of presence (category 1 in the binary classification) of the corresponding family. 

It could be that a NMR gives similar probabilities for different families, as in the glycosides case, where it is common to find NP families joined to a glycoside.    

After running the script the 'report' file shows the probabilities for each family as well as the probability of glycoside presence.

To run:

python predict_fams.py <13C shifts separated by spaces or commas>

Example:

python predict_fams.py 90.3 90 100.0 100.1 85.2
